# folderVerification

A simple java program to verify two folders are to be the same. I hardcoded the two folder locations two verify in the program (They are in main function). I should have probably done a commandline based input of two folders, but got lazy. 
There are much better (Seriously much much better and reliable) alternatives so I suggest you use those instead of this. This was just something I wanted to make, and probably something I want to evolve in future if I feel the need to do so.
